# The_Boarding_app

# Our mobile app, designed for university students, aims to streamline the search for boarding accommodations and introduce new features to enhance convenience:
🏠 Boarding Accommodation Search: Students can easily find nearby boarding houses, apartments, and rooms [1].

🍔 Food Ordering and Delivery: Introducing a new feature where students can order food from local restaurants and have it delivered directly to their boarding houses. This feature aims to provide convenience for students living in boarding accommodations [5].

🍽️ Restaurant Integration: Restaurant owners can register on our app to offer their food services directly to students. This integration not only expands dining options but also supports local businesses, fostering a vibrant community around university campuses [6].

🔧 Improvements and Fixes: We are dedicated to enhancing user experience by continuously addressing any issues and refining the app's functionality.
